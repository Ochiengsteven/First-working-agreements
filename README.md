Other agreements:

If we come up with a problem, we can easily solve it via text. We text each other and solve them or go on a Zoom call. 

Use this agreement with every learning partner you have at Microverse. If you have any misunderstandings, discuss them in a Zoom call since misunderstandings are more common in text or Slack messages. If you feel shy to talk directly in a Zoom call, we recommend sending your partner a Loom Video to communicate your frustration rather than using Slack or text messages. Using video will help you avoid misunderstandings and resolve things more quickly.
